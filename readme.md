# The User Management System Final Project: with BREAD operations for events ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ðŸ”¥

Through this course I learned a lot of new python libraries and how to build various components that help me in becoming a complete full stack developer /web application developer using python and its rich set of libraries. The knowledge of patterns and best practices, coding standards and guidelines, principles like DRY etc., are some of the very powerful skills to build on that this course enabled me to learn.

In my final project, I learned the importance of QA and the REST API capabilities of Flask API. I have also learned different ways of testing the application using Swagger. In terms of test case building, I learned the difference between testing the API vs class libraries or services. The REST API test cases can be used to simulate any future user interface that can use these APIs.

On the database side, I learned using PGAdmin tool and PostgreSQL database. I have also learned how to use the Alembic library and its migration process. By extending the application functionality to build custom events I was able to build end to end features from backend database table, alembic migrations, backend service, front end APIs and multiple test cases to test both the event management services as well as APIs.

Apart from all the external tools I have also learned how to write clear code, how to perform DevOps operations using GitHub Actions, Issue / Bug tracking and management, code merges and Pull Requests. These learnings will be helpful in real world production projects in the future.

To summarize, both the course and the project helped me a lot in understanding various aspects of application development such as requirement analysis, application design, testing, Deployment and DevOps processes.

# New Feature Implementation
For the final project, I have chosen to implement BREAD features for the events like adding/ creating an event, updating an event, reading an event. I found the initial setups to be painstakingly time consuming but once that was done and the first of the BREAD operations implemented, everything else flowed smoothly.
